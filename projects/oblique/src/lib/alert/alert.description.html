	Alerts provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions. They will be rendered in a colored box with a related icon, denoting the alert's type.
	They can accommodate any length of text.

<div class="ob-alert ob-alert-info">
	<strong>Angular</strong>
	<p>
		Although the alert feature is built on top of Angular, it can still be used without it. First, the <code>oblique-alert.css</code> file needs to be
		loaded. Then an alert can be displayed by setting both the <code>ob-alert</code> and one of <code>ob-alert-info</code>, <code>ob-alert-success</code>,
		<code>ob-alert-warning</code> or <code>ob-alert-error</code> classes.
	</p>
	<p>Please note that these alerts will be displayed with Oblique's icons instead of FontAwesome ones.</p>
</div>
