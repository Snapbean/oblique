<p>
	Alerts provide persistent contextual messages that are meant to highlight a text. They cannot be closed, if this feature is needed, please
	do consider using Notifications instead.
</p>
<p>Alerts can accommodate any length of text and will be rendered in a colored box with a related icon, denoting the alert's type.</p>
<div class="ob-alert ob-alert-info">
	<strong>Angular</strong>
	<p>
		Although the alert feature is built on top of Angular, it can still be used without it. First, the <code>oblique-alert.css</code> file
		needs to be loaded. Then an alert can be displayed by setting both the <code>ob-alert</code> and one of <code>ob-alert-info</code>,
		<code>ob-alert-success</code>, <code>ob-alert-warning</code> or <code>ob-alert-error</code> classes.
	</p>
	<p>Please note that these alerts will be displayed with Oblique's icons instead of FontAwesome ones.</p>
</div>
