<p>
	This component supports wayfinding by including breadcrumbs that reflect the information hierarchy of your site. The route configuration is used to discover
	the current page hierarchy. The breadcrumb property of the route data (<code>&lcub;path:..., data: &lcub;breadcrumb: 'Label'}}</code>) will be used as
	label. If no label is provided, the url is used as fallback. Dynamic routes are supported as well. The component will try to replace the parameter key
	(including <code>:</code>, i.e. <code>:id</code>) with the parameter value in the label of a dynamic route. URLs and parameter values displayed in a label
	are beautified, unless the input <code>beautifyUrls</code> is set to <code>false</code>. If a breadcrumb is cut off by the <code>maxWidth</code> input, a
	tooltip with the entire text is shown on hover.
</p>

<p>
	The root route ('/') will not be included in the breadcrumbs. The federal logo or application title should be used to navigate to the root page. The current
	page is displayed but not clickable, since there's no point in navigating to the current location. Other mechanisms should be used for reloading.
</p>

<p>
	Good to know: The breadcrumbs follows the route definition and creates only one breadcrumb per route. That means, if you have one route with the path
	<code>user/:userId/profile</code>, only one breadcrumb (not three) will be displayed. E.g. the default configuration applied to the route
	<code>user/123/profile</code> will yield the label <code>User - 123 - Profile</code>. If you want separate breadcrumbs, you need to define separate routes:
	<code>&lcub;path: 'user', children: [&lcub;path: ':id', children: [&lcub;path: 'profile'}]}]}</code>.
