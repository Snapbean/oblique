	Material Design proposes a lot of button variants, but for consistency reasons, Oblique limits this selection to just three alternatives. For that, Oblique
	proposes a directive, that, when used in conjunction with the <code>matButton</code> directive, applies the correct styles to the underlying button. The
	three variants are intended to reflect the importance of the button and are named <code>primary</code>, <code>secondary</code> and <code>tertiary</code>.
</p>
<p>
	Note that the <code>obButton</code> is meant to be used with the <code>mat-button</code> directive only. While material's other button variants are still
	possible, it is not advised to use them as this could lead to undesirable effects. Furthermore, the <code>ObButton</code> automatically sets the
	<code>color</code> input to <code>primary</code>, meaning that it should not be manually set.
</p>
<p>
	An icon within a <code>button</code> is expected to come before the text and therefore have a <code>margin-right</code> applied. Icons should be embedded as
	usual with e.g. <code>&lt;span class="fa fa-home">&lt;/span></code> and not with either the <code>mat-icon</code>
	component or the
	<code>mat-icon-button</code> directive.
