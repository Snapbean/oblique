<p>
	Material Design proposes a lot of button variants, but for consistency reasons, Oblique limits this selection to just three alternatives. For that, Oblique
	proposes a directive, that, when used in conjunction with the <code>mat-button</code> directive, applies the correct styles to the underlying button. The
	three variants are intended to reflect the importance of the button and are named <code>primary</code>, <code>secondary</code> and <code>tertiary</code>.
	Oblique only styles buttons that are marked with the <code>obButton</code> directive.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>obButton</code> directive is meant to be used with the <code>mat-button</code> directive for text buttons with or without icons. For icon buttons,
	i.e. buttons without text, the <code>mat-icon-button</code> directive is expected instead. While material's other button variants are still possible, it is
	not advised to use them as this could lead to undesirable effects. Furthermore, the <code>ObButton</code> automatically sets the <code>color</code> input to
	<code>primary</code>, meaning that it should not be manually set.
