<p>
	The column layout component comes with 1, 2 or 3 columns. Both side columns are collapsible / expansible and optional. They both use 20 % of the total width
	while the center column takes up the remaining 60%. The side columns can be enlarged with the <code>wider</code> option to use 40% each. This option is only
	suitable when only 2 columns are displayed.
</p>
<p>
	It comes with preconfigured padding which can be canceled with the <code>noLayout</code> input. On smaller viewports, both side columns are moved below the
	main one. This behavior can be tweaked by altering their <code>order</code> property.
</p>
<p>
	If the <code>ObColumnLayout</code> is set to a specific <code>height</code>, then it's <code>overflow</code> property has to be set to <code>auto</code> for
	it to work properly.
</p>
<p>To adapt the column width to your needs, overwrite following CSS rules:</p>
<pre>
@media (min-width: 992px) &lcub;
	.column-layout &lcub;
		.column-left,
		.column-right &lcub;
			flex-basis: $column-width;
			max-width: $column-width;
		}
		.column-left.collapsed &lcub;
			margin-left: -$column-width;
		}
		.column-right.collapsed &lcub;
			margin-right: -$column-width;
		}
	}
}
</pre>
