<p>
	The purpose of the column layout component is to display data in a central main column with a complementary drawer on each side. Both
	drawers are optional and feature the <code>complementary</code> role.
</p>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<details>
	<summary>Collapsed mode</summary>
	The collapsed mode is triggered when the viewport becomes too small to accommodate the desktop view. In this case, there is not enough
	room to display all three columns side by side. As the side drawers are complementary to the main column, they are pushed below it. This
	behavior can be tweaked by altering their <code>order</code> property:
	<pre>
.ob-column-left,
.ob-column-right &lcub;
	order: 0;
}
</pre
	>
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Full height</summary>
	When the master layout is configured with both a sticky header and footer, then the column layout should cover the whole available height.
	To achieve this, without unwanted scrollbars, three things must be done:
	<ol>
		<li>the master layout's <code>noLayout</code> option must be activated</li>
		<li>the <code>ob-full-height</code> class must be added to the <code>ob-column-layout</code> component</li>
		<li>there must be no code outside the column layout itself</li>
	</ol>
	In that mode, all three columns are independently scrollable.
</details>

<details>
	<summary>Sizing</summary>
	Per default, both drawers use 20% of the available width while the center column takes up the remaining 60%. The <code>wider</code> input
	can be used to enlarge the side columns to 40% but is not suitable in a 3 columns configuration. The drawers' width could be adapted by
	overwriting the following CSS rules:
	<pre>
@media (min-width: 992px) &lcub;
	.ob-column-layout &lcub;
		.ob-column-left,
		.ob-column-right &lcub;
			flex-basis: $column-width;
			max-width: $column-width;
		}
		.ob-column-left.ob-collapsed &lcub;
			margin-left: -$column-width;
		}
		.ob-column-right.ob-collapsed &lcub;
			margin-right: -$column-width;
		}
	}
}
</pre
	>
</details>
