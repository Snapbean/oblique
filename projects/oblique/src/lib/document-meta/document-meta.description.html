<p>
	This service is used to get, set and add page meta information such as the <code>content</code> attribute of the
	<code>&lt;meta name="description"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tags. To activate it, simply import it in the <code>AppModule</code>.
</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
	The description can be defined either globally on the <code>ObDocumentMetaService</code> or per route within the data object on routes definition:
	<code>&#123;path: 'home', component: HomeComponent, data: &#123;description: 'Description'}}</code>. The given string will be translated in both cases.
</p>
<p>Each time a page is loaded, the description will be updated with the page specific one if provided or the global one otherwise.</p>
<h3>Title</h3>
<p>
	The title is composed of three parts: the <code>page</code>, a <code>separator</code> and a <code>suffix</code>. If either the page or the suffix is missing,
	then the separator will be omitted as well. If both the page and the suffix are missing, then the title won't be changed.
</p>

<p>
	The page is defined per route within the data object on routes definition:
	<code>&#123;path: 'home', component: HomeComponent, data: &#123;title: 'Title'}}</code> and will be translated. If a route has no page defined, then the
	suffix will be show instead.
</p>
<p>
	Both the separator and the suffix can be set on the <code>ObDocumentMetaService</code> and will be used on all pages. The suffix will also be translated and
	typically reflects the application's name.
