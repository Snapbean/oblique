<p>
	This feature offers a nice way to display error messages related to a form element. The <strong>directive</strong> is meant for Material Design while the
	<strong>component</strong> is meant for Bootstrap.
</p>

<div class="material-only">
	<p>
		The <code>ErrorMessages</code> directive should be put on a <code>mat-form-field</code> component and works in conjunction with a
		<code>mat-error</code> component, both from Angular. The <code>mat-error</code> component have to be present through empty and will be automatically
		populated with translations of thrown validation errors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note the <strong>overflow behaviour</strong>: long error messages will be shortened to available space, but will still be wholly displayed when hovered
		or when the related input has the focus.
	</p>

	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<p>
			Make sure the <code>ErrorMessages</code> <strong>directive</strong> is used, as the <code>ErrorMessages</code> <strong>component</strong> is meant
			for the Bootstrap theme.
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="alert alert-warning">
		<strong>IE 11 & Edge 44</strong>
		<p>
			The overflow behavior does not work properly with those browsers. Meaning that long error messages will simply be cut off without any possibility to
			display them completely. As both browsers are no longer supported by the Confederation, this will not be fixed. Let us know if you really need a fix
			for that.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div class="bootstrap-only">
	<p>
		If used within the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component will automatically display the errors of the related control. In that case,
		the errors will be displayed in red, thanks to the <code>has-error</code> class set by the directive.
	</p>
	<p>
		When used outside of the <code>orFormControlState</code> directive, the component can be placed anywhere on the page but then the source control has to
		be specified through the <code>control</code> input. In that case, no styling will be applied to the content.
	</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
		<p>
			Make sure the <code>ErrorMessages</code> <strong>component</strong> is used, as the <code>ErrorMessages</code> <strong>directive</strong> is meant
			for the Material theme.
		</p>
	</div>
