<p>
	A transparent directive for external links that aims at improving both the security and the accessibility of such links. The default
	values can be configured through the <code>EXTERNAL_LINK</code> injection token. This directive is added automatically to every
	<code>a</code> tag and enhances those with an <code>href</code> value that does not match the current url.
</p>
<h3>Accessibility</h3>
<p>
	Accessibility is enforced by opening the link in a new tab while providing a visual hint in the form of an icon, and a text for screen
	readers. The position of the icon is configurable.
</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>
	Security is enforced by adding the <code>rel</code> attribute with the value <code>noopener noreferrer</code> to hide the source page from
	the destination.
