<p>
	This customizable feature is build iteratively to allow for a wide range of use cases. This means that some parts of this feature can be
	replaced by custom code according to one's needs. With the <code>file-upload</code> feature you can:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>chose the files to be uploaded;</li>
	<li>validate the chosen files;</li>
	<li>upload the validated files to a server;</li>
	<li>display information about the uploaded files in a table;</li>
	<li>select rows in the information table;</li>
	<li>delete files from a server.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	First, the <code>ob-drop-zone</code> component provides a drop zone where files can be dragged and dropped onto. This zone also reacts on
	mouse click and <kbd>enter</kbd> key (while the focus is on the component) for improved accessibility. Files provided to this component
	will be validated and the <code>uploadEvent</code> output will emit an event with the list of chosen files that do match all the file
	restrictions in place. An error notification will show filtered out files.
</p>
<p>
	Then, to actually perform the upload, the <code>ob-file-upload</code> component should be used instead. It wraps the
	<code>ob-drop-zone</code> component providing the exact same file choice and validation capabilities. The validated files will be
	automatically uploaded to the <code>uploadUrl</code> POST url if provided. The <code>singleRequest</code> option controls the number of
	actual HTTP requests. When enabled, all files will be grouped together in a single request. Otherwise, each file will be sent through its
	own request.
</p>
<p>
	Finally, the uploaded files can be visualised with the help of the independent <code>ob-file-info</code> component. It will fetch files
	from the server by calling the <code>getUploadedFilesUrl</code> GET url. This call expects a list of objects with, at least, a
	<code>name</code> property, but additional ones are accepted. The component then displays a simple table with one row per file and one
	column per field in the response. The hit list can be tweaked with the <code>mapFunction</code> that will be called in rxjs's
	<code>map</code> operator. Two additional columns are available to select and delete files. Files deletion is only available if a
	<code>deleteUrl</code> is provided and happens through a DELETE request to that url. File names are passed directly in the url as a base64
	encoded list of strings. If more control is needed, then a custom file list should be built.
</p>

<p>
	Each of these components exposes a <code>uploadEvent</code> observable that informs about its actual status. It emits
	<code>ObIUploadEvent</code> events that contain two properties: <code>type</code> and <code>files</code>. Each event type is described
	below:
</p>
<details>
	<summary>Description of upload events</summary>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<code>ObEUploadEventType.CHOSEN</code> is emitted by both the <code>ob-drop-zone</code> and the <code>ob-file-upload</code> components
			when files have been chosen and validated. Its <code>files</code> property contains an array of <code>File</code>s that are valid
			according to the configured restrictions.
		</li>

		<li>
			<code>ObEUploadEventType.UPLOADED</code> is emitted by the <code>ob-file-upload</code> component when the upload process is complete.
			I.e. all chosen files are either uploaded, canceled or couldn't be uploaded due to an HTTP error. Its <code>files</code> property
			contains an array of <code>File</code>s that have actually been uploaded to the server.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>ObEUploadEventType.ERRORED</code> is emitted by the <code>ob-drop-zone</code>, the <code>ob-file-upload</code> and the
			<code>ob-file-info</code> components when files are invalid (did not match one of the restrictions) or couldn't be processed due to an
			HTTP error. Its <code>files</code> property contains either an array of <code>File</code>s or an array of the name of the files. An
			additional <code>error</code> property provide the actual HTTP error.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>ObEUploadEventType.CANCELED</code> is emitted by the <code>ob-file-info</code> component when the upload of one or more files is
			canceled. Its <code>files</code> property contains an array of the name of the files whose upload have been canceled.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>ObEUploadEventType.DELETED</code> is emitted by the <code>ob-file-info</code> component when one or more uploaded files are
			deleted. The event is emitted after the DELETE request has returned. Its <code>files</code> property contains an array of the name of
			the files that have been deleted.
		</li>
		<li>
			<code>ObEUploadEventType.SELECTED</code> is emitted by the <code>ob-file-info</code> component when its file selection has changed.
			Its <code>files</code> property contains an array of the name of the files that are currently selected.
		</li>
	</ul>
