<p class="bootstrap-only">
	Adds <code>control-mandatory</code> class to highlight required elements. Also controls the <code>has-error</code>
	class to style the component in case of errors.
</p>
<p class="bootstrap-only">
	Required elements will be discovered by either <code>required</code> attribute on the related form control, <code>mandatory</code>input on the directive or
	<code>ngControl.errors.required</code> error on the related form control.
</p>
<p class="bootstrap-only">Works well with the <code>or-error-messages</code> component which displays the errors.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning material-only">
	<h2>Deprecated</h2>
	<p>
		This component is meant to be used with Bootstrap only. Material theme should instead use the
		<a href="https://material.angular.io/components/form-field/overview#error-messages">Angular implementation</a>.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-info bootstrap-only">
	<h2>Deprecated with Material Design</h2>
	<p>
		This component is only meaningful with Bootstrap theme. As a partially deprecated component, it won't be prioritized for new features or improvements
		but won't be removed as long as Bootstrap is supported.
