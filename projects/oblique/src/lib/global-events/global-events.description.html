	This is a simple service that acts as a proxy for some of the most used global events. It replaces the use of
	<code>@HostListener</code> for events triggered on <code>Document</code> or <code>Window</code>. Its goal is to reduce the number of
	listeners on global events and to provide a way to register those events only when necessary. For instance, one could listen to a
	<code>Document</code> click only when an element is in a given state.

	It also provides a function named <code>outsideClick$</code> that returns an observable that emits when a click is performed outside a
	given array of HTML elements.
