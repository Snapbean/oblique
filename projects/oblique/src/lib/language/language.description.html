	This module takes care of the languages and their corresponding locales. The <code>ObLanguageService</code>, which is instantiated by the master layout,
	provides an observable for the current locale that is used to set the <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element as well as
	informing all locale dependent features on the locale change. It also ensures that at least one locale is provided and that all locales are registered.
	Finally, it configures the <code>TranslateService</code> by registering the allowed languages and setting both the default and current language.
</p>
<p>
	The locales must be provided as two letters codes conforming to the ISO 639-1 standard. Language codes can be complemented with a two letters country code
	conforming to the ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 standard, both codes are joint by a hyphen.
</p>
<p>
	The <code>obDate</code> pipe simply wraps angular's <code>date</code> pipe and automatically reformats the date according to current locale. It also
	provides an additional <code>datetime</code> format which is its default value. Please note that the <code>obDate</code> is impure, meaning that its use may
	result in performance issues when used intensively, typically within a loop. In that case, it is advised to use angular's <code>date</code> pipe and provide
	it with the current locale through the <code>locale$</code> observable of the <code>ObLanguageService</code>.
