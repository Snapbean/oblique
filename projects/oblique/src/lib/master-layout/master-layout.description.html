<p>
	This component takes care of the page's structure. It contains the header and footer, manages off-canvas and spinner, and displays
	notifications. It is fully live configurable and its default values can be tweaked through the <code>MasterLayoutConfig</code>
	injectable. Padding is added per default to the
	<code>main-layout</code> and can be removed with the <code>layout.hasLayout</code> variable.
</p>
<p>
	The main navigation is generated from the <code>ObINavigationLink</code> input. It supports url fragments and query parameters as well as
	external links. External links will be automatically opened in a new tab, but they can be forced in the current one with the
	<code>sameTarget</code> property.
</p>
<p>
	Main navigation entries can also be enhanced with an icon that will be displayed on the left hand side of the link (the other side being
	reserved for the dropdown toggle). If the
	<code>ObUseObliqueIcons</code> injection token is activated, the icon is expected to be one taken from the <code>ObEIcon</code> enum.
	Otherwise, a Font Awesome icon name (e.g. <code>fa-anchor</code>) is expected. For consistency reasons, it is advised to either use icons
	for all entries or none of them.
