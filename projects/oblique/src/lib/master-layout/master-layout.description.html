<p>
	This component takes care of the page's structure. It contains the header and footer, manages off-canvas and spinner, and displays
	notifications. It is fully live configurable and its default values can be tweaked through the <code>MasterLayoutConfig</code>
	injectable. Padding is added per default to the
	<code>main-layout</code> and can be removed with the <code>layout.hasLayout</code> variable.
</p>
<p>
	The main navigation is generated from the <code>ObINavigationLink</code> input. It supports url fragments and query parameters as well as
	external links. External links will be automatically opened in a new tab, but they can be forced in the current one with the
	<code>sameTarget</code> property.
