<p>
	This component takes care of the page's structure. It contains the header and footer, manages off-canvas and spinner, and displays notifications. It is
	fully live configurable and its default values can be tweaked through the <code>MasterLayoutConfig</code> injectable. Padding is added per default to the
	<code>main-layout</code> and can be removed with the <code>layout.hasLayout</code> variable.
</p>
<p>Project that already features the <code>MasterLayoutComponent</code> should refer to the changelog for breaking changes.</p>
