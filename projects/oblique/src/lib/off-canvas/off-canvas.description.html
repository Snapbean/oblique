	A toggleable absolute position container to display supplementary info like help. It consists of a sidebar with a dark background that slides in from the
	right and takes up 40% of the available space.
</p>
<p>
	The content of the sidebar has to be placed into a container with <code>ob-off-canvas-sidebar</code> class that is a sibling to another container with the
	<code>ob-off-canvas-main</code>. The parent of both these container needs the <code>ob-off-canvas</code> class. Then, the
	<code>obOffCanvasToggle</code> directive, that can be applied anywhere, will control the state of the sidebar.
