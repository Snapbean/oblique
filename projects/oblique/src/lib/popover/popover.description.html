<p>
	A popover provides helpful contextual information in a dedicated container. It is meant for longer descriptions, help or additional
	actions that are not critical to the application.
</p>
<p>
	The template can be rendered either right after its toggle or at the end of the body. In any case, the template is removed from the DOM
	when not active. Adding it after the toggle element preserves the tabindex order. Focusable components should receive focus in an order
	that preserves meaning and usability. See
	<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-WCAG20-20081211/#navigation-mechanisms-focus-order"
		>WCAG 2.0 Supporting Documents 2.4.3: Focus order</a
	>. Unfortunately, this can lead to <code>z-index</code> problems that can only be solved by adding it at the end of the body.
</p>
<p>
	Accessibility is ensured through the <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute and the <code>tooltip</code> role. The positioning is
	achieved with the popper library, for more information see <a href="https://popper.js.org/">popper.js.org</a>.
