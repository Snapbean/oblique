<p>
	A popover provides helpful contextual information in a dedicated container. It is meant for longer descriptions, help or additional actions that are not
	critical to the application.
</p>
<p>
	The template is rendered at the end of the body to avoid <code>z-index</code> problems and is even removed from the DOM when not active. Its accessibility
	is ensured through the <code>aria-describedby</code> attribute and the <code>tooltip</code> role. The positioning is achieved with the popper library, for
	more information see <a href="https://popper.js.org/">popper.js.org</a>.
