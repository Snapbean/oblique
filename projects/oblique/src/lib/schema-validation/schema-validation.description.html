<p>Use a custom <a href="http://json-schema.org/">JSON schema</a> in order to perform automatic form control validation.</p>

	The service support JSON schema <code>draft07</code> out of the box. Older drafts need some configuration of the underlying plugin, please see the
	<a href="https://github.com/epoberezkin/ajv">relevant documentation</a>. Note that <code>Draft03</code> is only partially supported.

		If your project uses a CSP Policy, please note that the Schema Validation needs the <code>unsafe-eval</code> directive on <code>script-src</code> to be
		activated. This is a security downgrade that cannot be avoided. We are searching for a solution that doesn't require the
		<code>unsafe-eval</code> directive.
