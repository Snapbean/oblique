<p>
	This component is part of the master layout and shows a spinner within an overlay that covers the whole application. Other instances can be used throughout
	the application to block specific parts instead of it all. In this case, a <code>channel</code> has to be provided and the <strong>parent</strong> of the
	<code>ob-spinner-component</code> will receive the overlay. A custom spinner should be the last child of its parent.
</p>

<p>
	The spinner can be activated and deactivated through the <code>ObSpinnerService</code>'s corresponding functions. Starting from Oblique 6, the
	<code>deactivate</code> method only deactivates the spinner if it has been called as many times as the <code>activate</code> one. The
	<code>forceDeactivate</code> method allows to override this limitation.
