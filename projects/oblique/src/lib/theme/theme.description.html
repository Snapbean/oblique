	This is an internal feature of Oblique and should only be used when live theme or font change is required. The vast majority of projects won't need this
	service and should just stick to the configuration options.

<p>
	The desired theme, either <code>oblique-material.css</code> or <code>oblique-bootstrap.css</code>, should simply be loaded in <code>angular.json</code>'s
	assets array, after <code>oblique-core.css</code>. Alternatively, it could also be defined through the <code>setTheme</code> method of the
	<code>ObThemeService</code>. But do not use both ways together as it will lead to 2 separate themes being loaded simultaneously which will yield
	unpredictable results.

	The desired font, either <code>frutiger.css</code> or <code>roboto.css</code>, should simply be loaded in <code>angular.json</code>'s assets array.
	Alternatively, it could also be defined through the <code>setFont</code> method of the <code>ObThemeService</code>. But do not use both ways together as it
	will lead to the font being loaded twice which will yield unpredictable results.
</p>
<p>
	Because of licence restrictions, the <code>Frutiger</code> font files cannot be delivered with Oblique. Each project has to obtain the font files itself
	from <a href="mailto:webforum@bk.admin.ch">webforum@bk.admin.ch</a> or the
	<a href="https://intranet.bk.admin.ch/bk-intra/de/home/dl-koordination-bund/kommunikation/webforum-bund/Downloads.html">federal chancellery intranet</a> and
	put them into the <code>src/assets/fonts</code> folder. Each project is also responsible for the font protection according to its
	<a href="https://github.com/swiss/styleguide/blob/master/src/assets/fonts/LICENSE">licence</a>. The proposed solution consist of only delivering the font if
	the <code>Referer</code> Http header is whitelisted.
