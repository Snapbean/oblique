<p>Tracks and notifies about unsaved form changes and ask for confirmation in case of:</p>
<ul>
	<li>navigating to another route, see <code>ObUnsavedChangesGuard & ObUnsavedChangesDirective</code></li>
	<li>reloading the current browser tab, see <code>ObUnsavedChangesDirective</code></li>
	<li>closing the current browser tab, see <code>ObUnsavedChangesDirective</code></li>
	<li>closing the browser itself, see <code>ObUnsavedChangesDirective</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The custom message shown in the popup asking for confirmation can be changed by overriding <code>i18n.validation.unsavedChanges</code>. It
	is only shown when navigating to another route but not when leaving or reloading the page. In the latter case, the message comes directly
	form the browser and cannot be changed.
